# Steam Rating Prediction

##### The goal of this project is to predict the rating of computer games (pct_pos_total) based on other features (e.g., their genre, publisher, release date etc.)
###### some analysis of the dataset (e.g., statistics regarding its size or the distribution of individual features)
###### details on any preprocessing that you applied to the dataset (e.g., to clean it up by removing null values)
###### a detailed description of your approach (e.g., which method to do you use, which features do you consider)
###### a discussion of the experimental results (e.g., what is the performance that your achieves, how does it compare to other methods)
